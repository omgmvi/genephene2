# There´s a couple of problems with the file
# On one hand the end of line character is \r instead of \n
# On the other hand there are some unicode caracters that brings troubles when using columns and other tools

#The first is solved using translate
# But the second I can only solve by hand using VIM and changing the entry with UNKNOWN
# I will solve first the Unicode issue and then the EOL

cp IJSEM_pheno_db_v1.0.txt IJSEM_pheno_db_v1.0_NO_UNICHAR.txt
#manual change using VIM at what should be line 9 of four characters ä<8a>æ4 to UNKNOW
# To find the characters I have to make us in vim of the command :set list

cat IJSEM_pheno_db_v1.0_NO_UNICHAR.txt |tr "\r" "\n" > HidingPlainSightDB.txt
rm IJSEM_pheno_db_v1.0_NO_UNICHAR.txt 
#Now there´s no issue in doing
cat HidingPlainSightDB.txt |column -s -t|less -#2 -N -S

#As in the other databases, the command goes into an script see_tsv.sh
# The reason for columns -s -t |less -#2 -N -S can be seen at :https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1875305/view-tabular-file-such-as-csv-from-command-line 

# There are many modifications to the original database to clean mistakes like UNICODE wrong characters, excel substitution of ranges like 01-02 to 01-Feb and alike
# Also, the columns for GC, pH optimum etc have ranges and it will better to have them either averaged or splitting as min - max.
#Running the R script called extract_phenotypes.R make four new tsv files called
# ijsem.tsv | the original file but with the temperature, pH and other ranges averaged to make a single number and some errors in the tabs and also all the various aliases for 
# not available recoded as NA.

#Therefore is better idea to delete HidingPlainSightDB.txt and keep just the ijsem.tsv and link the see_tsv.sh script to this.

# The script 
Rscript ./get_phenotypes.R
# splits the file ijsem.tsv in other two files with the phenotypes related with carbonsubstrates and metabolic traits

#write.table(ijsem, file = "ijsem.tsv",row.names = F,sep = ",")#Almost the same than the original one but with some mistakes corrected ijsem.tsv
#Substrates.tsv wide format phenotypes related with carbon substrates used 
#Metabolic.tsv  wide format phenotypes related with metabolic reactions 
#The percentage of bacterias phenotyped for a given metabolism summary metabolic
#same for carbon substrates

# The script see_tsv is refered to the ijsem.tsv
# Also all script has been modified to comply with some rulels like all file being tsv and unquoted (except the species list)

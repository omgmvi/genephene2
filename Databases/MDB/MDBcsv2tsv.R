# Code to make the MDB.csv to compy with my own business rules.
# All tables are tabulation separated values
# All table has unquoted strings
# All strains must be in a single field, even if that breaks Codd's Normal Form (A single line records is used in bioinfo)
# Strain names will be duplicated as 1 field called Name and 2 fields Genus and Species
# If the original database have any record with multiple data in, usually corresponding to several substrates, it will be split in several columns

########################## Fixing the databases #########
# The code fix the issues with the databases (mostly erratas) and split fields with more than one value into many columns, keeping the number of rows constant
# Therefore I have to update the names in the helper arrays and keep an ID to avoid row movement problems (mostly the ID will be used during the field string splitting.
# I am separating the data into 4 databases according to the type of phenotypes it records.

# Metadata contains Strain names, and descriptions. Notice that a variable Max. cell GC content is also included due to be a text variable although it was expected to be a numerical. I well could have put it in the metabolic phenotypes. Anyway that variable is useless for any purpose.
# Environmental variable contains phenotypes regarding whether a bacteria lives or not in certain env. Won't be use neither in this project.

# numerical_phenotypes contain phenotypes concerning temperatures and Ph. and therefore numbers. The effort here is to keep in case in the future we use these values 
# but initially we will do classification. It needed a task of cleaning NA's and non-numerical values

# metabolic_phenotypes contain substrate utilization by the methanogenics. It require lots of processing for messy uncontrolled vocabulary plus the aditional and minimum 
# requirements being code as comma separated strings.

Experiment - 1 
Database : FAPROTAX
Genome : Bag of Words
Models : {glmnet,XGBoost}
Orthologs : {COG, KEGG,pFam}

Notes : This experiment contain only the BoW genomes for all the three orthologs databases and all the phenotypes at the FAPROTAX database
it was done separately (different folders) wich means that the Validation - Training dataset is made separately for every instance.
More clear, every row in the database is tested with a (potentially) different validation dataset, rather than sharing the dataset between models)
The results are in the files FAPROTAX_glmnet_BoW.csv (for the glmnet models) and FAPROTAX_XGBoost_BoW.csv, yet both files seem to be concatenated together 
to produce FAPROTAX_BoW.csv with all the rows together. However, there are some strange repetitions making me thing that it was some mistake when putting it together
(probably a error in tail -q -n +2 )

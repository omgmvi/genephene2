Experiment - 2-3
Database : FAPROTAX
Genome : Doc2Vec
Models : {glmnet,XGBoost}
Orthologs : {KEGG}
Ngenomes : {100,200,500,1000,5000}

Notes : This experiment contain only the Doc2Vect genomes but only for the KEGG orthologs database and all the phenotypes at the FAPROTAX database
it was done separately (different folders) wich means that the Validation - Training dataset is made separately for every instance.
In addition FAPROTAX_D2V_5000_KEGG.csv was a later run for the D2V 5000 genomes but the two files are really the same experiment.

Unfortunately the D2V genomes have been deleted, so  I am not sure if I can replicate the data.

I need to get the NCBI TaxID names for every bacteria.
I did a first try to parse the NCBI taxonomy DB, not being as inmediate as I initially thought. Yet, on the online search, I've read that since 2019 there's a new format of the DB and I was using th eold one.


NCBI Taxonomy: a comprehensive update on curation, resources and tools
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7408187/

This paper describes the databases and methods to access it.

In the new_taxdump, the taxonomy seems to have moved from a single database to multiple databases and focus around the idea of NameBank.
These NameBank seems to be a list of Species names and resources to work with them
http://ubio.org/index.php?pagename=namebank

On the paper they metion that in 2018 the addition of type strain was complete (that means that the taxdump I had downloaded can't be the same)


The TOC in me demands to see the database, I canÂ´t focus on the text

The file new_dump.tar.gz contains:

citations.dmp
delnodes.dmp
division.dmp
fullnamelineage.dmp
gencode.dmp
host.dmp
merged.dmp
names.dmp
nodes.dmp
rankedlineage.dmp
taxdump_readme.txt
taxidlineage.dmp
typematerial.dmp
typeoftype.dmp

Where of our interest are

names.dmp and typematerial.dmp


names.dmp
---------
Taxonomy names file has these fields:

	tax_id					-- the id of node associated with this name
	name_txt				-- name itself
	unique name				-- the unique variant of this name if name not unique
	name class				-- (synonym, common name, ...)


typematerial.dmp
----------------
Type material information file fields:

	tax_id					-- node id
	tax_name				-- organism name type material is assigned to
	type					-- type material type (see typeoftype.dmp)
	identifier				-- identifier in type material collection

Having a look:

cat names.dmp |grep "ATCC 25527"
703613	|	Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis ATCC 25527	|		|	scientific name	|
703613	|	Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis strain ATCC 25527	|		|	equivalent name	|
703613	|	Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis str. ATCC 25527	|		|	equivalent name	|


cat typematerial.dmp |grep "ATCC 25527"
28025	|	Bifidobacterium animalis	|	type strain	|	ATCC 25527	|


cat typematerial.dmp |grep "R101-8"
28025	|	Bifidobacterium animalis	|	type strain	|	personal::R101-8	|
28025	|	Bifidobacterium animalis	|	type strain	|	strain R101-8	|

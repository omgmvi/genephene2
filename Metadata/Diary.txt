Downloading the refseq file (as told by Seb)
Seb has done already the search of the species but I want to have a look to the file

wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/assembly_summary_refseq.txt

instruction file as on 14th July 2021

# Downloading the ncbi database summary

wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/assembly_summary_refseq.txt
wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/README_assembly_summary.txt

# Reading the columns of the assembly_symmary_refseq.txt file
head assembly_summary_refseq.txt -n 2|tail -n +2 |cut -d ' ' -f 1 --complement|tr '\t' '\n'

# To retrieve the name of available species
tail assembly_summary_refseq.txt -n +3|head -n 10  |cut -f 8,5

# To see a single record (obviosly, better to write an script)
head assembly_summary_refseq.txt -n 10|tail -n +10|tr '\t' '\n'

Let´s have a look to the file that Seb has generated from the bacteria taxa I sent him.
In his mail he says that was unable to find the Taxa:

"[...] I then used that info to download the maximum number of genomes related to theses species. 
That amount to 348 genomes. Well, out of the 44 species we're missing the 3 following : 
'Caldicoprobacter oshimai'
'Clostridium ganghwense'
'Lutaonella thermophila' [...]"


Let´'s upload the file from my computer (file was sent by mail)
from my own work laptop

scp -i Computing/private.pem ./odin_data.tar  ubuntu@137.205.69.12:./temp/


This creates a folder odin_data with few files:

KEGG_summary.tsv
cogs_summary.tsv
download_annotate.snake
genomes_metadata.tsv
name_to_taxid.tsv
pfamA_summary.tsv
reduced_assembly_summary.tsv

Those with name summary.tsv are the desired inputs for the model.
They contain tables were columns are the KEGG orthologs ID, COGs orthologs ID or PFAM ID
Their rows are the ID for the bacteria and the records seems to contain the number of orthologs of each type
for each genome. This number made me start thinking whether the presence of several time the same ortholog
may indicate stronger wether a pathway is important or not. On one hand, if a gene for glucolisis is present
in several versions, one could argue that the pathway is important and reduncancy contribute to robustness.
On the other hand, they may have different roles in different pathways and being activated in different pathways or by
different signals or to different substrates. 

name_to_taxid.tsv is the original name and the Strains (sparse) columns to help Seb looking in the assembly summary we looked before.


15th July
I carry on looking to what is in the files. I want to know what info are in the assembly file
head assembly_summary_refseq.txt -n 2|tail -n 1 |tr -d '#'> temp
cat assembly_summary_refseq.txt |grep "Bacteroides caccae" -P >> temp
cat temp|column -s , -t |less -#2 -N -S


The assembly file has as columns
head assembly_summary_refseq.txt -n 2|tail -n 1 |tr -d '#'|tr '\t' '\n'|tr -d ' '|nl
     1  assembly_accession
     2  bioproject
     3  biosample
     4  wgs_master
     5  refseq_category
     6  taxid
     7  species_taxid
     8  organism_name
     9  infraspecific_name
    10  isolate
    11  version_status
    12  assembly_level
    13  release_type
    14  genome_rep
    15  seq_rel_date
    16  asm_name
    17  submitter
    18  gbrs_paired_asm
    19  paired_asm_comp
    20  ftp_path
    21  excluded_from_refseq
    22  relation_to_type_material
    23  asm_not_live_date

where 1. assembly_accession is used at the moment to identify every phenotype in the files KEGG, cogs and pFamA (not sure the reason)
7. species_taxid that is the one that link with Seb's extra column at name_to_taxid.tsv file
8. Organism_name is the name as it should be canonically (not sure how well it is since it seems some strains has the type code attached.
9. infraspecific_name seems to contain the string Strain=______ with the strain name 
10. the ftp_path is the link to the reference genome and the one that Seb seems to be using for the ORF finding.

For example 
head KEGG_summary.tsv -n 3 |cut -f 1-5
/       K00003  K00004  K00005  K00008
GCF_000021425.1 1       0       0       0
GCF_000022705.1 1       0       0       0

show that KEGG summary file needs to be using the column assembly accession.

Same for the other two:

head cogs_summary.tsv -n 3 |cut -f 1-5
/       COG0001 COG0002 COG0003 COG0004
GCF_000021425.1 0       1       0       1
GCF_000022705.1 0       1       0       1
ubuntu@odinvm:~/Genomes/odin_data$ head pfamA_summary.tsv -n 3 |cut -f 1-5
/       PF00004.28      PF00005.26      PF00006.24      PF00009.26
GCF_000021425.1 1       47      2       6
GCF_000022705.1 1       47      2       6

How many COGS do we have?
KEGG KO´s
head KEGG_summary.tsv -n 1|grep "K\d{1,}" -P -o |wc -l
5137
head cogs_summary.tsv -n 1|grep "COG\d{1,}" -P -o |wc -l
3753
head pfamA_summary.tsv -n 1|grep "PF\d{1,}" -P -o |wc -l
5774

The view-like database table that Seb seems to be using is the genome_metadata.tsv

The last file is a snakemake config file that I still do not manage to fully understand.


so,what is the next step?
If I want to make models I need to join the table for KEGG or COG or pFam with my phenotypes and it should not be repeated since the number of columns will give troubles.
So, tomorrow I will start working on the model codes.
The idea will be to generate N configuration files with the address of phenotype and genome files, a phenotype to model variable, KO, COGS or pFams variable names to create the formula
and then, an script that will take the configuration file, join the data and perform any simple model (before turn to harder ones)


16th July 2021
I've wasted most of the morning with mails. So let's try to build simple models.
I will build a general pipeline that read the phenotypes, select the columns of interest and release the rest out of memory
Then join theh Bacterial name with Sebs name_to_taxid.txt, this one with the genome data (too long for a single column, isn't it?)
better, I will prepare the metadata file as single operation Taxa_name -> asembly_accession.
Then read the KO, COG, pFam file and perform a quick model (linear regression)
OK, hands on the computer

1.Merge of genome_metadata.tsv and names_to_taxid.tsv at $PROJECT/Genomes/scripts/TaxaName2TaxaID.R
2. I've notice that there´s a lot of names_to_taxid.tsv not found at genomes_metadata: It seems that there are ID's taken at the first column and some others at the second column (taxaid and species taxa Id) of the assembly_summary_refseq (or maybe just the genome_metadata has been created with the wrong column)

Well, I need to test the columns but the assembly file resist to be read with R
 cat assembly_summary_refseq.txt |cut -f 1,6,7,8,9,20|tail -n +3|tr "\'" '*' > assembly_headerless.tsv 
and also in the R code I have to deactivate the comment char since there are many # to separate things within the texts

21 July 2021
I've been busy with the ALIFE 2021 and lost a bit of track. 
It seems that I have to communicate better wit Seb and to share data I will upload everything to a private respositoire in GitHub.

So, last time I though he was getting the tax ids directly from the assembly_summary_refseq files but not, it turns out that the genome_metadata.csv is made manually by
looking for the taxids in BacDive and NCBI Taxonomy. It seems he had a bad experience doing it automatically in the past? Not sure if I understood him well.

So, at the moment, I will assume these files are fine and will build the model creator with the idea of making the complete scaffold and later fix all troubles.


Plan:
1. Finish the code to build a file with the table to convert the taxid given by Seb on the assembly_accession used on the genomes he provided.
2. Generate a set of R structures (lists) with fields for phenotype, phenotype file to retrieve, Orthologs file (KO, COGs or pFam).Each structure goes into a file and will be run in a model.
3. Generate an script to read the R lists as configuration file, run a model and write a file with the model output to analyse later.


July 30th 2021
Last week I have done the effort of clean and prepare properly the Hiding on Plain Sight, Methanogenes MDB and my own manual DB (still only acidogenics) as it seems to me that would work better with Seb (according to the files he sent me).
All data is now in tsv, with strings unquoted. Every database has 1 or 2 files in tsv with the metabolisms but also 4 columns for Genus, Species, Name and Strain being Name the concatenation of Genus and Species. In every folder there's a couple of files list_of_phenotypes (not quoted, not header) and list_of_species (quoted and with header)

MDB in particular has been painful to correct (but Hiding was the same a month ago)

So, now I can come back to the problem I was solving. Last time I had finished an script (/home/ubuntu/Genomes/scripts/TaxaName2TaxaID.R) that merge the current files genomes_metadata.tsv with name_to_taxid.tsv and produce a file (the script allow for changing the name)  TaxaID2assembly_accssion.table.tsv
That file is meant to be be used for linkint the species_taxid to the assembly accession that will link itself with the (COG|KEGG|pFAm)_summary. What is missing is the way to link the phenotypic data to the tax_id using Bacterial Names and Strains (in fact this will make all this unuseful, I reckon)

Today, I want to build a simple model to recognize the elements missing and how to automatize the creation and application of the models

When I left it, I had manage to get the taxa_id joins for the GenePhene2 (Acidogenics) so that every bacteria is now linked to its genome. Still had to complete the COG/KEGG/Pfam Join
2nd Aug 2021 - still with the model
3rd Aug 2021 - I've run few models and the news are mixed

I need more bacterials - the models has way more columns than rows and that make the matrices with low rank
I need less genomes per bacteria - some bact has lots of genomes in the database and some others just 1, that make unbalance the number of yes/no
I've notice that the gene fro Catalaase rarely can be determined but it may be related with the colinearity with previous variables

So, I am trying glm classification and lasso to get the code done but the model won´t work with so many variables and being some of them repeated.

4th August, 2021

I had a meeting with Seb and Chris. They go for holidays.
If I want Seb to run the KEGGs in a way so I get the .BED files have to do before Friday.
I have the feeling all this is being slow on my side and not very practical in communication, so looks like nothing is finished.

I download ncbi taxdum from https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump.tar.gz
which should be most of the taxonomy database with old and new names of every bacteria (and other taxa). My point here is to see wether I can find the Taxid of bacterias whose name has change since the publication of its type.

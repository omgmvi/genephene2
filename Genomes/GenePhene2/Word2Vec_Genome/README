The output of Word2Vec is not usable for our Genome to Phenotype modelling so I won't do anything with it. It is only here for the showing purpose

To read the files 
tar -xvf GenePhene2_Word2Vec.tar.gz

<Python>
import gensim
model = gensim.models.Word2Vec.load("GenePhene2_Word2Vec_COGS.dat")

and play with the index_2_key and key_2_index

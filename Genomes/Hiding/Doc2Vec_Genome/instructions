# Extract the contig files - first element in a row is the genome name - the rest are the ortholog genes (COG, KEGG or pFam) in order in a contig

tar -zxvf FAPROTAX_D2V.tar.gz

#These genomes need to be filtered out keeping those lines with more than N genes, e.g. 10 lines - since too small contigs may be a problem (actually don't since Doc2Vec pass a window)

# To perform the filter just run the code at 
~/GenePhene2/Genomes/scripts/remove_contig.sh <File> <Contig length>

# To apply to all files run better

~/GenePhene2/Genomes/scripts/remove_contig_files.sh <Expr> <Contig length>
# as said in the script:
# usage : bash ./remove_contig_files.sh "GENEPHENE2_*tsv" 10
# NOTE: The expression (glob) must be quoted!!! e.g. "*.tsv"


# Then you have to run your favourite genome summarizer - it could be a frequency table to make the bag of words 
# To run the doc2vec just modify the parameters (sorry -they are still harcoded as a variable - my bad)

# at  ~/GenePhene2/Genomes/scripts/D2V_scripts/Doc2Vec_Genomes.py change lines for the Absolute path 

#and the lines : 
## Handling file and folder names - rustic version
Ndim =1000
Ortho = "KEGG"
Geno = "FAPROTAX"

# To choose the type of phenotypic database <Genephene2|FAPROTAX|Hiding|MDB> and the type of ortholog <KEGG|COG|pFam> and the number of output columns (genome size)

# To finish run a little script that will put the header to the Doc2Vec Genomes

# ~/GenePhene2/Genomes/scripts/Add_D2V_header.sh <Expr> 
# Where the expression is again a glob to apply to several files as said in the usage
#usage : Add_D2V_header.sh "wildcard"

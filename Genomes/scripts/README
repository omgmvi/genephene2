To buid the Doc2Vec Genomes
the GenePhene2_D2V.tar.gz genome (a table with a contig per line)
has to be untar
then the small contigs are filter out with 
bash remove_contig_files.sh "GENEPHENE_D2V_*" 10 
to remove those with less than 10 genes
Then, the script in python Doc2Vec_Genomes.py
(by the time this is written the options has to be manually written within)
is run with options 100, 200 and 500 for the COG, KEGG and pFAM)
The headers are missing, so I generate them again with the script
Add_headers_D2V "GenePhene2_D2V_*_*.tsv"
